# LearnLissajousResults

LearnLissajous educational project results.

The project presents a new and unique perspective around Math teaching, particularly using Lissajous theme, and experiments with a group of High School and First years of college students.

In our research, we have developed a public and free [complementary WEB course](https://learnlissajous.com/).

## Highlights
- This study shows that the use of visual graphical learning can enhance algebraic learning
- We developed an online course to test this graphical learning method and provide free access worldwide, as well as access to data and analysis used in this paper
- We present a confusion matrix method to compare student group performance in both graph and math learning
- We built a mechanical drawing machine for the Lissajous pattern, in order to increase student motivation

## Abstract

In Math classes, students often inquire about how to draw the Lissajous pattern. 
In order to address this question from a pedagogical perspective, we developed a general vision-centered online teaching technique that is applied to the Lissajous subject, which is presented and tested. This technique stimulates the learning of algebraic knowledge with interactive graphical calculator examples. We then show the quantitative relation of visual and algebraic learning among the students as a result. Moreover, as a complementary result, we built a mechanical drawing machine using the course concepts to draw the Lissajous patterns. This physical device provided an opportunity to increase the student's interest in the subject.
